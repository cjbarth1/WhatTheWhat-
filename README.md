# WhatTheWhat-
Small app to compare the differences between the VGG16 and Resnet MLModels

This app will display in real time the two popular Apple MLModel's outputs (VGG16 and Resnet) to compare the difference in confidence in vision translation.

## Building
You will need to download both Machine Learning Models from Apple and include them in to your project's root directory. These can be found on Apple's [Machine Learning Page](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/).

## Usage
Point your camera at any object and see the item translation and confidence readouts on screen.
